        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor. He is often regarded as the
            greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. His extant works, including
            collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. His plays have
            been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other
            playwright.
